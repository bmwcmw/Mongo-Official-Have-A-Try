Let's suppose you have a five member replica set and want to assure that writes are committed to the journal and are acknowledged by at least 3 nodes before you proceed forward. What would be the appropriate settings for w and j?

F w=1, j=1
T w="majority", j=1
F w=3, j=0
F w=5, j=1
F w=1,j=3



HOMEWORK: HOMEWORK 6.3

Which of the following statements are true about choosing and using a shard key?


F You can change the shard key on a collection if you desire.
F The shard key must be unique
T MongoDB can not enforce unique indexes on a sharded collection other than the shard key itself, or indexes prefixed by the shard key.
T There must be a index on the collection that starts with the shard key.
T Any update that does not contain the shard key will be sent to all shards.

You have a sharded system with three shards and have sharded the collections "students" in the "school" database across those shards. The output of sh.status() when connected to mongos looks like this:

mongos> sh.status()

  sharding version: {
	"_id" : 1,
	"minCompatibleVersion" : 5,

If you ran the query
use school
db.students.find({'student_id':2000})
Which shards would be involved in answering the query?

F s0, s1, and s2
F s0
T s1
F s2
